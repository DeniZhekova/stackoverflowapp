_**The technology stack is basic MERN.**_

Client is written in React
Server is a node.js application using express.js
Mongoose is used to persist data to MongoDB
The application does very little on it's own, but the project demonstrates how you can structure a simple MERN application into a server and a client directory for automated deployment.

Example of the app running on Heroku: https://stackoverflowapp.herokuapp.com/
